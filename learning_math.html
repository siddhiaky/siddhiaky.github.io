            Hi! Iam Siddhi. I will teach math ages 5-9. Math is a easy subject, but that's my opinion. 
            <br>My goal is to make math more fun for everyone. So many people think math is hard. 
            <br>My favorite thing about math is that there's only one answer. 
            <br>So without farther to do let's get started.
